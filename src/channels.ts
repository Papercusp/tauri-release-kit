/**
 * Release CHANNELS — the model behind "which update lane is this build on, and
 * is it the same app or a different one".
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no app names, no host names. An app declares its channels once
 * via `defineChannelRegistry` and every surface that needs a channel-dependent
 * answer (which manifest to publish, which URL to poll, which bundle id to
 * build, which data home to write) asks the registry instead of re-deriving it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A BARE STRING UNION. A `Channel` union carries no
 * semantics, so each consumer re-derives them ad hoc — `if (channel !== 'alpha')`
 * scattered across a release script is six independent chances to disagree about
 * what a channel MEANS. Two of those derivations are load-bearing and fail
 * silently when they drift:
 *
 *  1. THE ROOT FEED. A shipped binary bakes ONE permanent manifest address and
 *     polls it forever. If a channel split moves that manifest, or hands it to a
 *     channel nobody actually cuts, every existing install silently stops
 *     updating — an updater cannot distinguish a failed check from "no update
 *     available", so it reports success forever. `rootFeed` makes exactly one
 *     channel the permanent root's owner, and the registry refuses to be built
 *     with zero or two of them.
 *
 *  2. THE DATA HOME. A channel that installs ALONGSIDE the main app
 *     (`distribution: 'side-by-side'`) is a different application: its own
 *     bundle id, its own name, and — the part that is easy to forget and
 *     expensive to get wrong — its own data home. A nightly build writing to the
 *     same state as the app someone actually works in is how a bad build costs
 *     real work. So a side-by-side channel without a distinct identity is not a
 *     bug to be caught in review; it is unrepresentable — `defineChannelRegistry`
 *     throws.
 *
 * The registry is the single exit: `resolveChannelIdentity` answers the bundle
 * id / product name / data home together, so the packaging config, the runtime
 * that picks a state directory, and the publisher that lays out feeds cannot
 * drift from one another.
 */

/**
 * How a channel's builds relate to the app already installed.
 *
 * - `update-lane`: the SAME application, reached by a different feed. Switching
 *   lanes is an update, not a second install — identity and data home are
 *   shared, deliberately, so a user who switches keeps their state.
 * - `side-by-side`: a DIFFERENT application that installs next to the main one
 *   rather than replacing it. Requires its own identity, including its own data
